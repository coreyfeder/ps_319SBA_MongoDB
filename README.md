## Ongoing notes
Why was it so much harder to create a repo without a template?

Can't find the stupid directions for Express setup
got these, to set up the system: https://www.canva.com/design/DAFrioYleHo/n00cM_6gH8OdQXpaAxUrrA/  

Okay, resurrect instructions for setup, since I can't find them.
0. make the repo git-happy
0. `npm init -y` ?
0. `npm i nodemon`
0. `npm i express`
0. `npm i mongodb` for this?
0. add an index.js (hello world is fine)
0. 
Hey! Found instrux at ps_rest-express/README.md.
* in package.json, get rid of `test` and add `"start": "nodemon index.js"`
* if necessary: add a `.gitignore`, and add `node_modules` to it

OFFS. Where's my package.json? Where's my node_modules/?
